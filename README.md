# GeneticAlg
Minimizes a function of two variables using a genetic algorithm. Treats each point as a chromosome, the x and y variables as the genes,
and the x and y values as alleles. The population size, iteration limit, mutation and crossover rate, and number of descendants to the
next generation can all be modified.
